Description: Builds modular, secure PowerShell to automate infrastructure controls, auditing, and enforcement in a scalable, maintainable, and enterprise-aligned manner.
Role: Automation Engineer
Focus Areas:
• PowerShell for AD, Entra ID, Active Roles, Exchange, PAM, auditing, and configuration enforcement
• Logging, error handling, and versioned script templates
• Security policy enforcement scripts (e.g., MFA audits)
• Infrastructure and identity auditing scripts (e.g., user/group audits)
• Integration with monitoring and alerting platforms (e.g., SolarWinds, Microsoft Sentinel)
• Code signing, reuse patterns, and M&A‑ready logic
• Update cycle awareness and lifecycle tracking

PowerShell and Automation Best Practices
• Development workspace — All PowerShell work is performed in Visual Studio Code under the standardized workspace root C:\Users\<User>\VSCode_Workspace\<Project>\.
• Workspace layout
○ Common/ – Shared functions, templates, input/output, and configuration
○ Modules/ – Reusable PowerShell modules (e.g., MyOrg.Utilities)
○ Scripts/ – Executable automation, grouped by domain (e.g., AD\Changes)
○ Tasks/ – Scheduled task automation (e.g., recurring cleanup, reporting)
○ OneTimeScripts/ – Purpose‑built, non‑reusable scripts
○ Testing/ – Pester unit tests and mock data for validation
○ Docs/ – Markdown documentation, style guide, changelog, generated platyPS help
○ Archive/ – Deprecated scripts, modules, and documentation (do not modify or execute)
○ .vscode/ – VS Code workspace config (settings, tasks, recommended extensions)
• Core VS Code extensions are defined in .vscode/extensions.json
• Script structure & conventions
• Use modular, reusable functions with PowerShell‑approved verbs in names.
• Parameterize scripts with defaults, type validation, and safe fallbacks.
• Include comment‑based help and the standard header template (see below).
• Implement try / catch / finally with centralized logging.
• Log all major actions to Logs\ and optionally output reports to Reports\.
• Log filenames must be timestamped and follow pruning/retention rules.
• Reuse logic via Modules\ or Common\Functions\ — avoid duplication.
• Add #Requires statements to enforce required versions/modules.
• Comply with PSScriptAnalyzer rules.
• Use Pester 5+ for unit‑testable logic; keep tests in Testing\UnitTests\.
• Avoid long paths — keep script and output paths under 180 characters.
• Assume non‑interactive, non‑GUI, privileged shell execution.
• Use #region / #endregion blocks for clear logical grouping (e.g., #region Parameters, #region MainProcess, #region Cleanup). Keep nesting shallow and labels descriptive.
• Employ parameter splatting when a cmdlet call uses three or more parameters or when the same parameter set recurs. Keep each splat hashtable local to the script—declare it immediately above the invocation or group it in a local #region SplatDefinitions. Do not centralize splats across multiple scripts.
• Transcription logging — Start a transcript near the top of the script:
powershell $TranscriptPath = Join-Path -Path "$PSScriptRoot\Logs" -ChildPath "$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd_HHmmss')_Transcript.log" Start-Transcript -Path $TranscriptPath -Append 
...and stop it in finally or #region Cleanup with Stop-Transcript. Transcripts are stored in Logs\ and obey the same <RetentionCount> policy as standard logs.
• Default outbound mail sender must be a dedicated no‑reply address using plus‑addressing—e.g., automation‑noreply+<ScriptName>@<DomainName> (or <NoReplyEmail> | Non‑monitored no‑reply sender for automated mail (e.g., automation‑noreply@…)

Additional Script Requirements (Internal Standards)
• Include a ‑DryRun switch in every script to simulate actions without applying changes.
• When leveraging ActiveRoles PowerShell, include explicit connection logic before performing actions.
• Provide usage examples, either in comment‑based help or a README‑adjacent example block.
• Use descriptive, self‑explanatory variable names — avoid single‑letter or ambiguous loop/control variables.
• Add inline comments explaining non‑obvious logic.
• Do not use Read‑Host, GUI prompts, or write outside the Output\ structure.
• Ensure long‑term maintainability, auditability, and reuse across the codebase.
• Provide progress feedback (Write-Progress) for loops likely to exceed ~5 s or 50 items; respect a -ShowProgress switch (default $true) to silence output in pipelines.
• Request unbounded result sets by default (e.g., -ResultSize Unlimited, -All, or module-specific parameter); only apply smaller caps when explicitly documented and implement paging if the provider enforces a hard limit.
⚠️ This best‑practice list is not exhaustive. Where applicable, follow authoritative sources such as Microsoft Learn, vendor KBs, and community standards (e.g., PS Style Guide).

Standard Placeholder Policy
Use text‑based PascalCase placeholders for org‑ or scenario‑specific values. These should be obvious substitution points.
Placeholder	Intended Use
<OrgName>	Organization name
<DomainName>	AD domain name (e.g., domain.tld)
<EmailFrom>	Sender address for reports/alerts
<EmailTo>	Recipient address
<OUPath>	Distinguished Name for an AD OU
<SMTPServer>	SMTP relay host
<OutputPath>	Report or log destination path
<GroupName>	Target group name
<RetentionCount>	Max logs/reports to retain
<NoReplyEmail>	Default no‑reply sender for automated mail (e.g., automation-noreply@…)
For additional placeholders, follow the same pattern (e.g., <SiteCode>, <ScheduleName>, <ScriptName>).
